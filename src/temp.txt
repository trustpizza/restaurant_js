 <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium underline">A Little About Us</h2>
              <p>
                We are a small business started in 2018 focusing on bringing the joys of wild Maine blueberries
                all over New England.  Located on Isle Au Haut, an Island off the coast of Maine, we offer a Bed
                and Breakfast to those who wish to enjoy the bucolic scenery of our island farm.  We also ship
                our blueberries, maple syrup, and farmhouse goods all over New England.  Find us in your local
                grocery store or stop by for a weekend getaway!
